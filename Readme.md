<p>Hey if you are reading this you may be curious about my site? yes?</p>
<p>HEY, i made a streming website using HTML CSS JS NODE.JS. You can watch free movies/Anime here i have limited content coz i use my google drive as my video hosting server </p>
<p>I made a API to fetch and update users/movies data from data.json  i have't added users login in Frontend site of the website so soon i'll add  </p>
<p>My fav. part of this site is it can automatically upload the content according to the length of my data.json so if i want to upload i can just update my data.json i know it's a long process and yeah i can use my API to send data like my usesr data and i know that i'm gona use that ASAP </p>
<p>My site has some bugs in UI i'll that SOON </p>
